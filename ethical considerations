companies:
- https://www.mylabbox.com/#
- https://www.gettested.com/
- http://www.mymately.com/index.php

business model:
- The tests range in price  
- pay out of pocket for all of them
- upside / aka - Insurance companies don’t have to know the frequency or results of your tests (neither do and mom and dad, if you’re a 25-year-old on your parents’ plan)
- MyLAB Box kits range from $79 for a single test to $399 for a 10-panel screen
- GetTested offers just one, eight-test kit for $199 that covers the most commonly contracted STDs, including HIV and syphilis. 
- Mately formally launches next year, geared toward the LGBTQ crowd, they’ll offer a subscription model: a $70 joining fee followed by a $30 membership to test for HIV monthly, with add-ons for other test

- The technology behind these tests isn’t new. What these companies are selling is the convenience and privacy of home
- Mately plans to go one step further, giving you a badge for your dating profile to prove you’ve been tested. 
- mately: Once you connect with someone you can share those results privately via a Snapchat-esque encrypted URL.

front-end (marketed goal)
- he end goal is noble: empowering people to own their sexual health and act responsibly. But these companies didn’t just pop up because of an altruistic desire to eradicate STDs. 

back-end (driver / rationale)
- D2C LAB TESTS - They exist because of a regulatory ruling that lessened federal oversight on at-home tests for consumers.
- On page five, footnote four, the agency stated that it would not be exercising enforcement discretion for direct-to-consumer tests, whether or not they met the definition of a lab-developed test

lack of regulation concerns:
- That lack of regulation means you should probably be skeptical of these companies’ services. 
- Even if all the individual tests they offer have been approved by the FDA, only two tests—both for HIV—have been approved for home collection.1 
-Without direct oversight and with little transparency into the manufacturers and labs each company works with, there’s room for error.
Labs can mix up samples and botch tests.
